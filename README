This is a simple go package to allow you to read and write from the
serial port.

It aims to have the same API on all platforms, including windows.

Currently there is very little in the way of configurability.  You can
set the baud rate.  Then you can Read(), Write(), or Close() the
connection.  Read() will block until at least one byte is returned.
Write is the same.  There is currently no exposed way to set the
timeouts, though patches are welcome.

You may Read() and Write() simulantiously on the same connection (from
different goroutines).

Basic usage is as follows:

package serial

import (
        "github.com/tarm/goserial"
        "log"
)

func main() {
        s, err := serial.OpenPort("COM5", 115200)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
        
        n, err := s.Write([]byte("test"))
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
        
        buf := make([]byte, 128)
        n, err = s.Read(buf)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
        log.Print("%q", buf[:n])
}
